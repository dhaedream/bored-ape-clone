## General Info

This is a clone of one of the most popular NFT Collections website. I created this project to showcase my front-end skills with react.js.
My deployed website is [here](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/home) .
The original website is [here](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/home) .


## Installation

Must have Node installed. To start this project, download this repo  locally and run :

```bash
cd ../lorem
npm install
npm start
```
Individual dependencies used:

```bash
npm i react
npm i react-icons
npm i ionicons
npm i react-router-dom
```

## Requirements

This project is guaranteed to work on the latest NPM + Node versions.
I created this project using node v16.14.2 and npm v8.5.0.

## Status
This project can be improved. I would enable a wider range on font weights. The google-fonts are not as bold or thin as the original. I would enable router-dom v6 to add more pages. I could add an nft marketplace connected to a test blockchain network using ethers.js.
